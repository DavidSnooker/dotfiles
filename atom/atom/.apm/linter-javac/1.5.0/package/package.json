The default (javac) should work as long as you have it\n  # in your system PATH.\n  javaExecutablePath: \"javac\"\n  # Extra classpath.  This will be appended to the classpath when executing javac.\n    classpath: \"\"\n```\n\n## Classpath\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you configure your classpath via a `.classpath`\nfile within your project (typically at the root). Simply create a file\nnamed `.classpath` somewhere within your project (ideally at the root of\nthe project). The linter will search for this file by starting at the directory\nof the file being compiled and then searching all parent directories within the\nproject. If you have more than one of these configuration files, it will use\nthe one that is \"closest\" to the file being compiled. Within `.classpath` place\nonly the classpath to be used for the project (nothing else). For example:\n\n```java\n.:./lib/junit.jar\n```\n\nThis linter will execute `javac` within the directory of the `.classpath`\nfile, so relative paths can be considered to be relative to that file.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-javac/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-javac#readme","_id":"linter-javac@1.5.0","_shasum":"7ac688ad772063ac4b34db3445c4811964682fac","_resolved":"file:../d-116015-39742-16ajp8a/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116015-39742-16ajp8a/package.tgz"}
